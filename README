This is the initial proof of concept for a twitter command line tool.  Now that I understand the problem, I am currently in the process of writing a more robust implementation.

Until I release tweetline gem you will need to put the "tl" file in a folder in your path and make it executable.

Until I get access to xAuth you will have to create a ~/.tweetlinerc yaml file with your authentication credentials like the following...

:consumer_key: "your-key"
:consumer_secret: "your-secret"
:oauth_token: "your-token"
:oauth_token_secret: "your-secret"
